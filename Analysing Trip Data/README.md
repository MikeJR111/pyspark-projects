## Background:
87Drive is an online marketplace, where drivers are the supply and passengers, are the demand.
One of our main challenges is to keep this marketplace balanced. If there's too much demand,
prices would increase due to surges and passengers would prefer not to run. If there's too much
supply, drivers would spend more time idle impacting their revenue. Here, we want to employ
various operations on the dataset using Spark to answer different queries.

## Dataset:

The data used here is a simulated dataset, which mainly records trips that happened on the
87Drive platform in 2019 across different cities. The data is available on the website:
